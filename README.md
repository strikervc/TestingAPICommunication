# TestingAPICommunication
An example of communication between your project in Xamarin.Forms and a REST API for consume it.

My workgroup choosed the WordsAPI (https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi?endpoint=54b86419e4b058c0230e421c) for search definitions, synonyms, syllables and more. The concept of our application was around a pharmacy and its products, but we did not find an API to meet our needs, so we chose to switch to an app that works as a word dictionary, and help the user with grammar topics.

##### EndPoint used: Get Definitions
